## Course Overview

This repository contains coursework completed for **ANA 670: Applied Optimization Methods**, a graduate-level course focused on the **theory and practical implementation of optimization algorithms** used in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and engineering applications.

The course provided a rigorous treatment of **both classical and modern optimization techniques**, emphasizing **mathematical foundations**, algorithmic behavior, and the conditions under which different methods succeed or fail. Analytical derivations were complemented by computational experiments using **Python** and **Wolfram Alpha**.

This course was particularly impactful, offering a deep and intuitive understanding of optimization that connects mathematics directly to real-world problem solving.
